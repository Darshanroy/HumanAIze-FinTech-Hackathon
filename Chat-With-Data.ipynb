      "\n",
      "1. Law of Murder: This law deals with the offense of murder, which is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Right of Private Defence: This law allows a person to use reasonable force to defend himself or his property from an unlawful attack. The force used should not be unduly disproportionate to the injury being averted or reasonably apprehended.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Provocation: This is a legal doctrine that can reduce a charge of murder to manslaughter, if it can be shown that the accused acted under extreme emotional duress. However, the provided context does not seem to discuss this in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Law of Injuries: This law deals with the consequences when a person inflicts injuries of a kind that could potentially lead to death. Even if death is not the intended outcome, the person must still face the consequences. However, if it can be reasonably deduced that the injury was accidental or unintentional, the person may escape punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Law of Evidence: This law is involved in the enquiry process, particularly in proving the intention to cause bodily injury. Once the intention is proved, the rest of the enquiry is objective and focuses on whether the injury was accidental or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Criminal Procedure Laws: These laws govern the process of investigating, charging, and trying a criminal case, such as murder. The context mentions a Criminal Appeal No. 328 of 2012, indicating that the case is being appealed in a higher court, suggesting that these procedures are being followed.\n"
