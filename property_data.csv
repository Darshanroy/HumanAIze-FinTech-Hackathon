rejected the issue involved in adjudication is not in  respect of
an agreement entered into by the appellants similar agreemen ts
were also entered into with the authority by such i dentically
situated landholders who have been granted addition al
compensation subsequent to the agreement by carving  out a
distinction on the basis of period of residenceoccupati on of the
land which was acquired by creating an artificial class ification of
pushtaini and gairpushtaini landholders furthermor e since
the issue of additional compensation by making an a rtificial
classification of pushtaini and gairpushtani was n ot in existence
at the time of the agreement there was no occasion to c hallenge
the same further specifically in the context of the grant of ex
gratia payment it is to be noted that the said payment gr anted to
pushtaini landowners through a separate notificatio n was
assessed and given after the agreement was signed  by both
pushtaini and gairpushtaini landowners the appellants  herein
under those circumstances could not have challenge d the
agreement vis a vis the exgratia payment on grounds of viol ation
of article 14 when no such violation existed at the tim e of the
agreement no man can be expected to predict a future violation
of their rights and file a preemptive appealthe a ppellants

for payment of compensation at different rates is liable to b e struck

reasonable classification test
for any classification to survive the test of article 14 th e
classification must be based on intelligible differentia and it must
have a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by t he
law the object sought to be achieved must also be lawful and if
the object of the law itself is found to be discrimi natory then
such discrimination must be struck down para 33451cd ramesh chandra sharma v state of uttar

22 while prima facie the classification and the o bject
sought to be achieved through the said classificati on seems
reasonable however the devil lies in the details the ju stification
given by the gnoida authority and the fullbench of the  high
court assumes that only pushtaini landowners permanent ly reside
in the subject land or that the subject land is the primary source
of income only for pushtaini landowners and this assumption has
been backed by no empirical data produced by the authority while
the classification made by greater noida has been based on the
object of giving fair compensation however such a laudable object
of the classification would stand breached by the effec ts of such a
classification creating a dissonance between the obj ect and its
effect many gairpushtaini landholders whose main  area of
residence or their main source of income is also the subj ect land
would be subject to great discrimination and injustice if  the same
compensation that has been granted to the pushtaini landhol ders
is not extended to them paras 38 39455fh 456ab
23 wednesbury principle
the classification made by gnoida does not find its footing
in the land acquisition act or the upland acquisition  rules
and hence is contrary to law the said classification also su ffers
from not taking into account relevant consideration s the
authority without taking into account any empirical data or
calculating any possibility of gairpushtaini landown ers being
rendered landless or without a primary source of income m ade
the impugned classification these relevant factors by not being
taken into account can and would cause great injustice to  gair
pushtaini landowners further gnoida by arbitrarily classif ying
the landowners as pushtaini and gairpushtaini on the bas is of a
cutoff date have taken into account an irrelevant fa ctor the
cutoff date by itself without any context of the landow ners on
ground is not indicative of who the most adversely  affected
landowners are by not complying with these three factors while
making the classification this court must strike d own such a
classification paras 44 45457fg 458ab

object sought to be achieved and thus violates th e first two
prongs of the proportionality test coming to the third and fourt h
prong of the proportionality test ie whether the c lassification
created by the authority was a necessity to achieve the s tate aim
of compensating those landowners that are either direct r esidents
46 of the land or the land exists as their primary source of inco me
and whether such measure was proportional to the object  sought
to be achieved for this it is pertinent to refer to sect ion 23 of
the act which provides for matters to be taken into account wh ile
determining the compensation a bare perusal of section  23 would
show that the grounds for classification as purpor ted by the
gnoida authority have already been covered by section 23 of
the act the fifth point of the said section square ly covers the
requirement of compensating for rehabilitation of t he affected
landowners in the presence of an already existing provi sion in
the act the classification created by the gnoida author ity must
exist in furtherance of the said section and not in  contrast of
paras 5254465bd 466cd
25 the classification if allowed to exist can lead to sever al
gairpushtaini landowners who may also need to be rehabili tated
cannot rehabilitate themselves without compensation  for the
same this circumstance alone besides being discriminatr oy pits
the said classification against section 23 of the act causing an
insubordination to the 1894 act such a mischief if allowed to
exist would not only nullify the purpose of the act but  also violate
the third and fourth principle of the proportionality tes t and hence
is liable to be struck down further it is also import ant to note
that the classification even if allowed to exist does not come
with any safeguards against its potential abuse as mentioned
above the said notification by way of its classificat ion creates
disastrous mischief and the notification does nothing to remedy
such potential abuse no guidelines for the said classif ication exist
nor are there any bars placed if such classificati on is left
unchecked it may lead to bad precedence and disas trous
ramifications in the future this lack of substantiv e guidelines
also violates the fifth prong of the proportionalit y test the
impugned classification is liable to be struck down as violat ive of
article 14 of the constitution of india paras 5557466 dhramesh chandra sharma v state of uttar

the high court between pushtaini landowners and gairpu shtaini
landowners is in contravention to the law laid down by this  honble
court in the case of nagpur improvement trust and another vs
vithal rao and others  1973 1 scc 500
the classification made by the gnoida authority for the
purposes of awarding differential compensation is bad in l aw and
it is precisely this kind of classification that has  been barred
when the purpose of the acquisition of the land is for t he benefit
of the public at large then the nature of the owner of  the said
land is inconsequential to the purpose if such a classi fication on
the basis of the nature of owner is allowed then o n the same
grounds there might be a possibility of future classific ations where
powerholding members of the society may get away with a large r
compensation and the marginalized may get lesser compensation
this is precisely what this court in the abovementioned j udgment
predicted and to preempt such arbitrary classification  clarified
the position in law the land acquisition act does not dis tinguish
between classes of owners and uniformly provides compen sation
to all class of landowners the classification made  between
pushtaini landowners and gairpushtaini landowners on th e basis
of the reasoning mentioned above is violative of t he law laid

on
41 the classification made by both the executive actio ns
is bad in law and is liable to be set aside the land acq uisition
act does not envisage any differential compensation on the basis
of such classification and hence this court must infer the
compensation to be provided by the executive actions wit hin the
confines of section 23 of the act section 23 of th e land
acquisition act states out the grounds for granting compe nsation
in cases of acquisition of land under the act one su ch reason for
the grant of compensation is rehabilitation and it is this need for
granting compensation for rehabilitation under the act that is
echoed by the impugned notification a bare reading of both the
executive actions in consonance with the act would show that
the need for giving compensation for rehabilitation is valid i n law
and is backed by the parent statute the mischief the n is only
limited to the arbitrary classification made by suc h actions in
such a case since the mischief lies only within the cl assification
it can be severed and the remaining part of the executi ve actions
that sets out to grant compensation for the purpose  of
rehabilitation remains valid in law once the class ification is
removed and the executive actions are read in consonance wit h
the parent act it would be seen that since the act and  now even
the executive actions do not discriminate in terms of
compensation the ex gratia payment and the increas ed base
amount as enunciated by the executive actions must b e given
to all landowners in the subject area paras 62 63468h  469

42 further in cases of administrative action even if the
classification has a rational nexus to the objectiv e of the
notification the classification must also be legit imized by the
parent statute if the parent statute does not allo w for a
classification then even if the classification vi sàvis the
notification is able to pass the tests of article 14 it would  still be
liable to struck down if the parent statute does not allow  for the

circumstances 
11 writ petition no 61449 of 2009 smt madhuri srivasatava

filed by certain landholders whose land was acquire d by noida
challenging the decision of the board of directors of noida da ted
07011998 as also the approval granted to the said resolution by the
state government dated 02032009 whereby a distinction was carved
out in the matter of payment of compensation by creat ing a classification
between pushtaini and gairpushtaini landholders the  pushtaini
landholders whose lands were acquired were given a dditional
compensation  rs3 per sq yard along with 15 as rehabili tation
bonus on the compensation already awarded as also the 10 area of
the acquired land whereas those who were declared as gai rpusht
xcaini were denied this additional benefit a division benc h of the high
court vide judgment and order dated 10052016 dismissed the writ
petition holding the classification to be reasonable having di rect nexus
with the object sought to be achieved ie rehabilitation of th e original
residents who are likely to become landless due to the acquisi tion of
their land

appellants challenging a similar classification made  by the greater noida

framed the following questions for adjudication 
i whether the law laid down by a division bench of this
court in the case of smt madhuri srivastava  reported in
2016 6 adj 1 is in conflict to the law laid down by the
supreme court in the case of nagpur improvement trust
and another vs vithal rao and ors2 and also with the
provisions of the land acquisition act 1894
ii whether the classification made under the up land
acquisition determination of compensation and decl aration
of award by agreement rules 1997 the distinction made
among pushtaini and gairpushtaini farmers is a
classification having reasonable nexus with the obj ect sought
to be achieved
5 vide impugned judgment and order dated 30032018 the full
bench answered question no 1 in negative and question  no 2 in
affirmative and upheld the view taken by the division benc h in the case
of smt madhuri srivastava supra  as a consequence of the answers
to the questions framed the full bench held that nothing remains to be
decided in the writ petitions filed by the present appella nts and the same
were dismissed
6 before we enter into the factual matrix of the case we find it
expedient to first trace out the etymology of the words pusht aini and
gair pushtaini used in the impugned classification for lang uage once
adopted inside the realm of law materializes itself a much more powerful
being one which must be understood in the right historical conte xt
7 the word pushtaini is a persian word and finds its orig in from
the word pusht which means back the said word  has been historically
used in the context of ancestry any possession tale or legen d that has
roots to a particular ancestry to denote its significance  to the said
ancestry the word pushtaini is used as is obvious since  the word
gair which finds its origin in urdu language means other than thus
gairpushtaini would mean one which is not pushtaini
8 what we find most interesting however is that ancestry as  a
concept especially before times of modern private prope rty ownership

had remained to be a tool for inclusivity and not exclusion in such a
context the use of the word pushtaini by the authority to excl ude
compensation might be a historically inaccurate interp retation while
this is not consequential to the merits of the case it is in our opi nion a
worthwhile observation for law has to power to legitimize the  meaning
of words and can change the context in which a word used and in tur n
can change the course of history itself
background facts
9 since the early 1970s liberalization took over india by storm
and it brought with it the promise of massive economic growth a  huge
amount of money was infused in the indian economy with the purp ose
of developing indian cities into massive global hubs of c apital and
business in line with this delhi began its journey of becoming a global
city this influx of capital into the city also brought wit h it massive
employment opportunities and people from all over the count ry started
migrating to delhi to contain such influx of migra nts and ensure dignified
living for all who came to the city with the hopes of i mproving their lives
the government of india planned to develop residential and indus trial
areas around the capital for this gurgaon was developed acr oss the
border of haryana and new okhla industrial development authori ty
noida was developed by the uttar pradesh government in  the
adjoining district of gautam budh nagar in this period the city  enjoyed
massive growth both in terms of influx of capital and migrati on this
growth was so unprecedented that it even exceeded t he planning estimates
as envisaged by the authorities as a measure to accommodate such
growth the uttar pradesh government exercising its powers under
section 3 of the up industrial area development a ct 1976 by
notification dated 28011991 created the township of greater noida in
an area of 38000 hectare comprising of 124 villages of gautam b udh

acquisition of land within its territorial area of operat ion under the
provisions of land acquisition act hereinafter referred to  as  1894
act in the same connection notifications dated 031 02005 and

present appellants were subject matter of challenge bef ore the high
court in a bunch of writ petitions challenging the acquisition proceedings
mainly on the ground of arbitrarily invoking urgenc y clause under sections
171 read with section 17 4 of the 1894 act the bunch of the said
writ petitions came to be decided by the another full bench o f the high
court titled as gajraj vs state of up3 the high court concluded that
the urgency clause was wrongly invoked but saved the acquis ition for
the reason that much development had already taken place over  the said
land and the nature of land stands completely changed the full be nch
further in order to compensate the landholders directed an additiona l
compensation to be paid to the landholders at the rate of 6470  of the
already paid compensation and a further direction was issued to allot
developed abadi land to the extent of 10 of their acqui red land subject
to a cap of rs2500 square meter the full bench never m ade any
distinction between pushtaini and gairpushtaini  farmers for payment
of the additional compensation or allotment of land the f ull bench also
relying upon the decisions rendered in the case of radheyshyam dead
through lrs  ors vs state of up  ors4 greater noida
industrial development authority vs devendra kumar   ors5
further held that merely because the farmers had received com pensation
under an agreement it cannot be said that they have waived off the right
to challenge the same the full bench judgment in gajraj supra
came to be affirmed by this court in savitri devi vs state of up

land acquisition proceedings were initiated and not ification under sections
4 and 6 of the 1894 act were issued the respondentgreater n oida in

the land prior to the date of establishment of authority ie 28011991 or
thereafter got the land by partition or family settlem ent and gair

establishment thus two classes of landholders were carved out for
payment of compensation and those who were classified as pus htaini
landholders a higher amount of compensation was de cided to be awarded
to them in the name of their rehabilitation
13 subsequently on 15072006 an agreement was entered into
between greater noida and the appellants and other landholders under
rule 42 of the land acquisition rules 1997 hereinafter referred to
as 1997 rules and in accordance with the resolution passe d by greater
noida in its 26th meeting the pushtaini landholders were paid
compensation  rs 322 per sq yard and the gairp ushtaini landholders
including the appellants herein were paid a lesser amount of compensation
 rs280 per sq yard
14 the landholders continued with their agitation maki ng demand
of further compensation at the enhanced rate which resulted in
constituting a committee to consider the demand of enhanced r ate of

arguments advanced by the appellants
20 the learned counsel for the appellants contended that
i section 23 of the land acquisition act does not allow for a
discrimination between pushtaini  and gairpushtaini
landowners in determination of compensation under t he land
acquisition act
i in light of the law laid down by this court in the nagpur
improvement trust case supra  no distinction between
the abovementioned two sets of classes of landowners can
be made on the basis of the date of purchase of the land
and the date of establishment of g noida the ld
counsel argued that all the landowners whose land was
acquired should stand on the same pedestal
ii the land of both the classes of landowners have been
acquired under the same procedure for the same public
purpose and having the same market value and hence any
difference in the rate of compensation provided to any par ty
is highly discriminatory and is violative of article 14
iii further it has also been argued that merely by sig ning the
agreement the appellants herein cannot be said to have
waived their right to appeal the compensation especially
since the fact that the exgratia payment granted to the
pushtaini  landowners was awarded after the agreement
was signed
iv it has also been contended that the exgratia payment as a
form of compensation does not exist in the land acq uisition
act and can only be interpreted as one of the reasons for
payment within section 23 of the land acquisition act and
in such a scenario the payment must be universally made
to all parties
arguments advanced by the respondents
21 the ld counsel for the respondents contended that
i the up land acquisition rules have been formed under
the land acquisition act1894 these rules prescribe for
method of compensation between the acquirer and theramesh chandra sharma v state of uttar
pradesh krishna murari ja
b
c
d
e

g
h446 supreme court reports 2023 2 scr
acquiree through an agreement the appellants by way of
an agreement voluntarily accepted the compensation being
granted to them further while accepting the compens ation
the appellants herein also submitted an affidavit stating
that the compensation is agreed upon and accepted by the
parties it was only three years later that the appellan ts
decided to file a writ challenging the compensation after
entering into the agreement and explicitly agreeing to the
compensation amount
ii the appellants had entered into an agreement as per the
law of the land and had accepted the compensation granted
to them in such a scenario there exists no legal remedy o f
the appellants to reopen the agreement on grounds of a
subsequent increase in compensation to a different party
there is no remedy to reopen the agreement by way of
approaching the court in the statue
iii the distinction created between the two classes of l and
owners has been done on the basis of their residence the
base compensation given to both the classes is the same
and only an additional 15 extra amount is given to
pushtaini landowners as rehabilitation bonus which is not
a necessity for the gairpushtaini  landowners as they do
not reside in the concerned land and are not sons of the
soil
iv as regards to the exgratia payment given to the pushtaini
landowners the same is merely an additional compensation
based on the classification between sons of the soils and
mere investors in the land the payment is based on
reasonable classification and is not violative of article 14
issues
22 in the aftermath of the aforesaid litigations in the high c ourt
the following three questions arise for adjudication in these a ppeals 
i whether the appellants by signing the agreementhave
waived their right to seek for revised compensation
ii whether the classification made under the land acq uisition
act and the up land acquisition rules1997 betweena
b
c
d
e
f
g
h447
pushtaini landowners and gairpushtaini landowners for
the payment of compensation at different rates is liable  to
be struck down as violative of article 14 of the co nstitution
iii whether the classification made by the fullbench of the
high court between pushtaini landowners and gairpu shtaini
landowners is in contravention to the law laid down by this
honble court in the case of nagpur improvement trust
and another vs vithal rao and others 1973 1 scc 500
23 we have heard shri pradeep kant learned senior counsel
for the appellants shri ravindra kumar learned sen ior counsel
appearing for the greater noida and shri ravindra kumar raiz ada
learned counsel for the state of upaag at great length
24 at the outset we would like to clarify that in  the present appeals
we are only concerned with the legality and validity of  action of g  noida
paying an enhanced compensation to the landholders by carving out an
artificial class of pushtaini landholders from among the sam e class of
landholders whose land was acquired by the same notification for the
same purpose there is no challenge to the validity of th e acquisition
itself as the same stands finally settled by this court
analysis
whether the appellants are bound by the compensation as
per the agreement under the land acquisition rules a nd
have waived off their right to seek enhanced compensation
25 it has been vehemently submitted on behalf of greater no ida
that the appellants herein did not exhaust their remedy under sect ion 18
of the land acquisition act and approach the high court a nd has
sidestepped a procedural requirement section 18 of the 1894 act reads
as under 
reference to court  1 any person interested who has not
accepted the award may by written application to the collect or
require that the matter be referred by the collecto r for the
determination of the court whether his objection b e to the
measurement of the land the amount of the compensa tion
the persons to whom it is payable or the apportionm ent of
the compensation among the persons interestedramesh chandra sharma v state of uttar

2 the application shall state the grounds on which objection
to the award is taken provided that every such appl ication
shall be made
a if the person making it was present or represente d before
the collector at the time when he made his award within six
weeks from the date of the collector s award
b in other cases within six weeks of the receipt of the notice
from the collector under section 12 subsection 2 or with in
six months from the date of the collector s award whicheve r
period shall first expire
26 the first and foremost thing to be taken note of is tha t the
nature of the challenge in the writ petition filed by the a ppellants before
the high court was based on violation of article 14  which is a fundamental
right enshrined in the constitution such a challenge irrespectiv e of the
existence of any alternative remedy under a statute cannot pu t a bar on
the jurisdiction of the constitutional courts
27 the respondent authority argued that since the agreement
was consented to no challenge could exist in the court th is argument
in the facts of the case has been raised only to be re jected the issue
involved in adjudication is not in respect of an agreemen t entered into by
the appellants similar agreements were also entered into with the
authority by such identically situated landholders who have been granted
additional compensation subsequent to the agreement by carving out a
distinction on the basis of period of residenceoccupation of the land
which was acquired by creating an artificial classificati on of pushtaini
and gairpushtaini landholders
28 furthermore since the issue of additional compensatio n by
making an artificial classification of pushtaini and  gairpushtani was
not in existence at the time of the agreement there was no occasi on to
challenge the same
29 further specifically in the context of the grant of  exgratia
payment it is to be noted that the said payment granted to p ushtaini
landowners through a separate notification was assessed and giv en
after the agreement was signed by both pushtaini and gairp ushtaini
landowners the appellants herein under those circumstances could
not have challenged the agreement vis a vis the exgratia payment ona

grounds of violation of article 14 when no such violation existed at the
time of the agreement no man can be expected to predict a  future
violation of their rights and file a preemptive appeal  this court is
reminded of the words of francis bacon who in the 17th century wrote
about the link between legal certainty and justice
for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare
himself to the battle so if the law give an uncertain sou nd
who shall prepare to obey it it ought therefore to warn before
it strikes let there be no authority to shed blood  nor let
sentence be pronounced in any court upon cases exc ept
according to a known and certain law nor should a man be
deprived of his life who did not first know that he was r isking
it quoted in coquillette francis bacon pp 244 and  248
from aphorism 8 and aphorism 39 a treatise on univer sal
justice
30 on the basis of the abovementioned reasons we are of  the
considered opinion that the appellants because of their signi ng of the
agreement have not forfeited their right to seek revised comp ensation
because the cause of action accrued to them much after e ntering into
the agreement the issue no 1 is answered accordingly in the negative
and in favour of the appellants
whether the classification made by and executive fi at
between pushtaini landowners and gairpushtaini
landowners for payment of compensation at different rates
is liable to be struck down as violative of article 14 of t he
constitution
31 the high court while upholding the classification between
pushtaini and gairpushtaini landowners stated that there is no
discrimination being caused to similarly situated p arties and the judgment
rendered by the division bench in the case of smt madhuri srivastava
supra  lays down the correct law thus the full bench upheld the
classification and negated the challenge made to the said cla ssification
the relevant paragraphs of the impugned judgment are repr oduced
hereunder 
before coming on merits of the case it would be appropr iate
to state that sovereign power of state to acquire p rivate

while dealing with an issue pertaining to classifica tion and
its reasonability we must also keep in mind that the governan ce
is not a simple thing it encounters and deals with the proble ms
which come from persons in an infinite variety of re lations
classification is the recognition of those relation s and in
making it a wide latitude of discretion and judgment must b e
given
having considered all aspects of the matter by keep ing in
mind the constitutional provisions discussed above and al so
the intent of the act 1894 especially the provisions of sections
23 and 24 of the act 1894 we are of considered opinion that
the classification introduced among the pushtaini and  gair
pushtaini farmers is reasonable with intelligible di fferentia
and that in no manner causes any discrimination among the
similarly situated person the law laid down in the case of
smt madhuri srivastava supra has taken adequate care of
all these provisions while concluding that the pushtaini  anda
b

d

f
g
h451
gairpushtaini farmers are two different classes and  the
resolution to award additional compensation on different rates
is not at all discriminatory
32 to assess the validity of the impugned classification we  must
put it through the rigours of article 14 and see whether it surv ives the
baptism it is a well established principle of law that t he state as per
article 14 cannot deny equality before law and equal protection of  the
law
reasonable classification test
33 for any classification to survive the test of article 14 the
classification must be based on intelligible differentia  and it must have a
rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the law at this
stage it is important to note that the object sought to be achieved must
also be lawful and if the object of the law itself  is found to be
discriminatory then such discrimination must be struck down  this has
been held in a catena of judgments
34 the reasonable classification test was first int roduced to indian
jurisprudence in the case of state of  west bengal vs anwar ali
sarkar7  the issue raised therein was against the bengal special c ourts
act which was enacted for the purpose of speedier trial  of certain
offences this act was challenged on the touchstone of article 14 on
grounds of the act giving arbitrary powers to the state government the
court while dismissing the appeal of the state held that
it can be taken to be well settled that the principle underlying
the guarantee in article 14 is not that the same rules of l aw
should be applicable to all persons within the indian territo ry
or that the same remedies should be made available to them
irrespective of differences of circumstances chara njit lal

the subjectmatter of the legislation their position  is
substantially the same this brings in the question  of
classification as there is no infringement of the equal
protection rule if the law deals alike with all of  a certain
class the legislature has the undoubted right of cl assifying
persons and placing those whose conditions are substantially
similar under the same rule of law while applying d ifferent
rules to persons differently situated it is said that the  entire
problem under the equal protection clause is one of
classification or of drawing lines  dowling  case s on
constitutional law 4th edn 1139 in making the
classification the legislature cannot certainly be expec ted to
provide abstract symmetry it can make and set apar t the
classes according to the needs and exigencies of the  society

evasive it must rest always upon real and substant ial

i am not at all impressed by the argument of the le arned
attorney general that to enable the respondents to invoke
the protection of article 14 of the constitution it has got  to be
shown that the legislation complained of is a piece of hostile

do not think that it is incumbent upon him before he can

and prove that in making the law the legislature was actuated
by a hostile or inimical intention against a particular person
or class for the same reason i cannot agree with the learne d
attorney general that in cases like these we should enq uire
as to what was the dominant intention of the legisl ature in
enacting the law and that the operation of article 14 w ould
be excluded if it is proved that the legislature had no intenti on
to discriminate though discrimination was the nece ssary

by article 14 of the constitution the state is enjoined not to
deny to any person equality before the law or the e qual
protection of the laws within the territory of india the article
forbids class legislation but not reasonable classific ation in
making laws the test of permissible classification under an
act lies in two cumulative conditions 1 classification under
the act must be founded on an intelligible differen tia
distinguishing persons transactions or things grou ped
together from others left out of the group ii the diff erential
has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by
the act there must be a nexus between the basis of
classification and the object of the act
the legislative policy as to the necessity is a mat ter of
legislative judgment and the court will not examine  the
propriety of it the legislation need not be all embracing and
it is for the legislature to determine what categories wil l be
embraced in dalmia case ram krishna dalmia v sr 
tendolkar 1959 scr 279 it was said that the two t ests of
classification were first that there should be an i ntelligible
differentia which distinguished persons or things g rouped
from others left out and secondly the differentia must hav e a
rational relation to the object sought to be achieve d by the
statute

of navtej singh johar  ors vs union of india thr se cretary
ministry of law and justice9 while considering the question of

test of reasonable classification under article 14 as under

propounds is that all like should be treated alike in othe r
words it implies equal treatment for all equals thoug h the
legislature is fully empowered to enact laws applic able to a

classification including the one made under section 377 ipc

classification must be founded on an intelligible d ifferentia
and the said differentia must have a rational nexus wi th the
object sought to be achieved by the provision that is s ection
377 ipc
section 377 has consigned a group of citizens to the margi ns it
has been destructive of their identities by imposing the sanctions
of the law on consenting adults involved in a sexual r elationship it
has lent the authority of the state to perpetuate social  stereotypes
and encourage discrimination gays lesbians bisexuals and
transgenders have been relegated to the anguish of closeted
identities sexual orientation has become a target for
exploitation if not blackmail in a networked and digital ag e
the impact of section 377 has travelled far beyond the
punishment of an offence it has been destructive of an ident ity
which is crucial to a dignified existence
37 in the case at hand it has been held by the full bench of the
high court that the classification between pushtaini  and gairpushtaini
landowners is based on one class of landowners being sons of the soi l
while the other class being mere landowners who are not  directly
attached to the land further the object of this classification as st ated
by the full bench of the high court is to rehabili tate the original residents
ie the sons of the soil who are likely to become landless due  to the
acquisition of their land
38 while prima facie the classification and the object s ought to
be achieved through the said classification seems reasona ble however
the devil lies in the details the justification given by the gnoida
authority and the fullbench of the high court assumes th at only
pushtaini landowners permanently reside in the subject land or that the
subject land is the primary source of income only f or pushtaini
landowners and this assumption has been backed by no empirica l data
produced by the authority
39while the classification made by greater noida has  been based
on the object of giving fair compensation however  such a laudable object
of the classification would stand breached by the effects of  such a
classification creating a dissonance between the object a nd its effectramesh chandra sharma v state of uttar

many gairpushtaini landholders whose main area of residence or  their
main source of income is also the subject land would be subjec t to great
discrimination and injustice if the same compensation that  has been
granted to the pushtaini landholders is not extended to them
40 further it is also to be noted that this court at thi s stage cannot
enter into a fact finding mission to verify the claims of the r espondent
authority to justify such a classification the respo ndent authority should
have discharged their burden of proof to back their  claim mere statements
without any evidence cannot be accepted by us as justificati on for the
said classification which can have a debilitating effect on those who are
at the losing side of the classification
41 to survive the rigors of article 14 the impugned classification
must not only make it through the abovementioned test but also clear
the wednesbury principle and by extension the proportionalit y test
wednesbury principle
42 in the case of associated provincial picture houses limited
v wednesbury corporation10 the kings bench division was tasked
with the question of under what circumstances can the court interfer e
in cases of administrative law making while dealing with this the court
held that interference in administrative decisions was permissible only if
i the order was contrary to law ii or relevant factors were not
considered or iii irrelevant factors were considered or iv or the
decision was such that no other authority under similar circum stances
would have come to this conclusion the relevant paragraph  of the
judgment are reproduced herein
in the result this appeal must be dismissed i do not wish t o
repeat myself but i will summarize once again the pri nciple
applicable the court is entitled to investigate the  action of
the local authority with a view to seeing whether they have
taken into account matters which they ought not to take into
account or conversely have refused to take into account or
neglected to take into account matters which they ou ght to
take into account once that question is answered in f avour
of the local authority it may be still possible to  say that
although the local authority have kept within the four corners
of the matters which they ought to consider they h ave
nevertheless come to a conclusion so unreasonable th at no

reasonable authority could ever have come to it in s uch a
case again i think the court can interfere
the power of the court to interfere in each case is not as an
appellate authority to override a decision of the l ocal
authority but as a judicial authority which is concerned and
concerned only to see whether the local authority have
contravened the law by acting in excess of the powers which
parliament has confided in them the appeal must be dismissed
with costs
43 the wednesbury principle was first introduced to i ndian
jurisprudence in the case of om kumar  ors vs union of india11
here again a similar question was posed before the supreme  court as
to when can the court exercise its power of judicial review in cases of
executive law making this court reiterated the same principle s laid
down in the wednesbury case the relevant extracts from  the said
judgment is reproduced hereunder
lord greene said in 1948 in the wednesbury case 1948 1
kb 223  1947 2 all er 680 ca that when a statute gave
discretion to an administrator to take a decision the scope of
judicial review would remain limited he said that interfere nce
was not permissible unless one or the other of the f ollowing
conditions was satisfied namely the order was cont rary to
law or relevant factors were not considered or ir relevant
factors were considered or the decision was one whic h no
reasonable person could have taken these principles  were
consistently followed in the uk and in india to jud ge the
validity of administrative action
44 the classification made by gnoida does not find its footin g
in the land acquisition act or the upland acquisi tion rules and hence
is contrary to law the said classification also suffers from  not taking
into account relevant considerations the authority without taki ng into
account any empirical data or calculating any possibi lity of gair
pushtaini landowners being rendered landless or without a primary
source of income made the impugned classification these r elevant
factors by not being taken into account can and would cause grea t
injustice to gairpushtaini landowners

45 further gnoida by arbitrarily classifying the landowners
as pushtaini and gairpushtaini on the basis of a cutoff date have
taken into account an irrelevant factor the cutoff date  by itself without
any context of the landowners on ground is not indicative of who the
most adversely affected landowners are by not complying wi th these
three factors while making the classification this co urt must strike down
such a classification
46 while the wednesbury principle has been used as a guid ing
principle of interpretation the indian court have now adopted a much
more rigorous test ie is proportionality test to see whether an
administrative action can survive the rigours of articl e 14
proportionality test
47 in the case of om kumar supra  this court held that the
administrative measure must not be more drastic than is nec essary for
attaining the desired result this was the first formal intro duction of the
proportionality test to indian jurisprudence however the court  pointed
out that the proportionality test has been used by the indian courts even
before this judgment the relevant paragraphs from the said report reads
as under 
27the principle originated in prussia in the nine teenth
century and has since been adopted in germany france and
other european countries the european court of justice at
luxembourg and the european court of human rights a t
strasbourg have applied the principle while judging the
validity of administrative action but even long bef ore that
the indian supreme court has applied the principle of
proportionality to legislative action since 1950 as stated
in detail below
28 by proportionality we mean the question whether while
regulating exercise of fundamental rights the appropria te or
leastrestrictive choice of measures has been made by the
legislature or the administrator so as to achieve the object of
the legislation or the purpose of the administrative orde r as
the case may be under the principle the court will se e that
the legislature and the administrative authority maint ain a
proper balance between the adverse effects which th ea

legislation or the administrative order may have on the rig hts
liberties or interests of persons keeping in mind the p urpose
which they were intended to serve the legislature a nd the
administrative authority are however given an are a of
discretion or a range of choices but as to whether the choi ce
made infringes the rights excessively or not is for t he court
that is what is meant by proportionality
29the above principle of proportionality has been applied
by the european court to protect the rights guaranteed under
the european convention for the protection of human rights
and fundamental freedoms 1950 and in particular f or
considering whether restrictions imposed were restr ictions
which were necessary  within articles 8 to 11 of the said
convention corresponding to our article 191 and to find
out whether the restrictions imposed on fundamental freedoms
were more excessive than required handyside v uk 1976

the purpose of law while summarizing the aforementioned p rinciple
into a fourpronged test the bench held
the action must be sanctioned by law
the proposed action must be necessary in a democratic society
for a legitimate aim
the extent of such interference must be proportionate t o the
need for such interference
there must be procedural guarantees against abuse o f such
interference
50 in the case of gujrat mazdoor sabha supra  during covid
19 the central government had passed a notification severely af fecting
the pay of unskilled workers on the grounds of national emerg ency
this notification was challenged on grounds of violation of ar ticle 14
specifically in violation of the principle of propo rtionality the court held
that in order to determine the validity of state action that could infringe
on fundamental rights it must pass the following conditions namel y i
the interfering with the fundamental rights must have a s tate purpose
ii the said rights infringing measure must be based on a  rational nexus
between the interference and the state aimiii the measur es bust be
necessary to achieve the state aimiv the restriction s must be necessary
to protect the legitimate objective and v the state should provide
sufficient safeguards for the possibility of an abu se of such rights infringing

that in in the gujarat mazdoor sabha case supra  to complete the

the principle of proportionality has been recogniz ed in a

bench decision in k s puttaswamy vs union of india  the
principle of proportionality envisages an analysis of the
following conditions in order to determine the validity of s tate
action that could impinge on fundamental rights
i a law interfering with fundamental rights must be in
pursuance of a legitimate state aim
ii the justification for rightsinfringing measur es that
interfere with or limit the exercise of fundamental rig hts and
liberties must be based on the existence of a ratio nal
connection between those measures the situation in fact and
the object sought to be achieved
iii the measures must be necessary to achieve the  object
and must not infringe rights to an extent greater t han is
necessary to fulfil the aim

must also be necessary to protect them and

52 we have already in the discussion for the reaso nable
classification test held that the interfering law ie the impugned notification
that creates the classification does not have a rational  nexus to the
object sought to be achieved and thus violates the first two pro ngs of
the proportionality test
53 we then come to the third and fourth prong of t he proportionality
test ie whether the classification created by the  authority was a
necessity to achieve the state aim of compensating those la ndowners
that are either direct residents of the land or the land exi sts as their
primary source of income and whether such measure was proport ional
to the object sought to be achieved for this it is pert inent to refer to
section 23 of the act which provides for matters to b e taken into account
while determining the compensation the said section reads as  under   
23 matters to be considered in determining compensa tion
""
1 in determining the amount of compensation to be awarded
for land acquired under this act the court shall t ake into
consideration
first the market value of the land at the date of the publ ication
of the notification under section 4 subsection 1 
secondly the damage sustained by the person intereste d by
reason of the taking of any standing crops trees whic h may
be on the land at the time of the collectors taking poss ession
thereof
thirdly the damage if any sustained by the person interest ed
at the time of the collectors taking possession of the land
by reason of serving such land from his other land
fourthly the damage if any sustained by the pers on
interested at the time of the collector s taking poss ession of
the land by reason of the acquisition injuriously affecting
his other property movable or immovable in any other manner
or his earningsramesh chandra sharma v state of uttar

fifthly in consequence of the acquisition of the l and by the
collector the person interested is compelled to ch ange his
residence or place of business the reasonable expe nses if
any incidental to such change and
sixthly the damage if any bona fide resulting from dimi nution
of the profits of the land between the time of the publica tion
of the declaration under section 6 and the time of the
collectors taking possession of the land
54 a bare perusal of section 23 would show that the grounds for
classification as purported by the gnoida authority have a lready been
covered by section 23 of the act the fifth point of the said s ection
squarely covers the requirement of compensating for rehabilit ation of
the affected landowners in the presence of an already e xisting provision
in the act the classification created by the gnoida authori ty must
exist in furtherance of the said section and not in contrast of
55 the classification as discussed above if allowed to exist can
lead to several gairpushtaini landowners who may also need to be
rehabilitated cannot rehabilitate themselves without comp ensation for
the same this circumstance alone besides being discrimina troy pits the
said classification against section 23 of the act causing an insubordination
to the 1894 act such a mischief if allowed to exist would not only
nullify the purpose of the act but also violate th e third and fourth principle
of the proportionality test and hence is liable to be st ruck down
56 further it is also important to note that the classific ation even
if allowed to exist does not come with any safeguar ds against its potential
abuse as mentioned above the said notification by  way of its
classification creates disastrous mischief and the  notification does nothing
to remedy such potential abuse no guidelines for the said cla ssification
exist nor are there any bars placed if such class ification is left unchecked
it may lead to bad precedence and disastrous ramificat ions in the
futurethis lack of substantive guidelines also violates the f ifth prong of
the proportionality test

from the settled principles issue no 2 is answered in affi rmative and in

whether the classification made by the fullbench of t he high
court betweenpushtaini landowners and gairpushtaini land owners
is in contravention to thelaw laid down by this honble co urt in the
case of nagpur improvement trustand another vs vithal  rao and
others 1973 1 scc 500
58  in the case of nagpur improvement trust supra this
honble court was tasked to deal with the question of whether cer tain
provisions the nagpur improvement trust act 1936 were in violation of
article 14 here the impugned provisions of the said act allow ed the
acquisition of lands at rates lower than the rates as pre scribed in the
land acquisition act what is relevant to our case is that the court
while deciding this matter held that the authority while a cquiring land
cannot distinguish between types of owners as the object of a chieving
land for public purposes is met with irrespective of the typ e of owner
whose land is being acquired the relevant paragraphs from the judgment
reads as under
it is now wellsettled that the state can make a reas onable
classification for the purpose of legislation it is equal ly well
settled that the classification in order to be reasonab le must
satisfy two tests i the classification must be f ounded on
intelligible differentia and ii the differentia m ust have a
rational relation with the object sought to be achieved by the
legislation in question
in this connection it must be borne in mind that the  object
itself should be lawful the object itself cannot b e
discriminatory for otherwise for instance if the object  is to
discriminate against one section of the minority th e
discrimination cannot be justified on the ground that there is
a reasonable classification because it has rational  relation
to the object sought to be achieved
what can be reasonable classification for the purpo se of
determining compensation if the object of the legislati on is to
compulsorily acquire land for public purposes
it would not be disputed that different principles of
compensation cannot be formulated for lands acquire d on
the basis that the owner is old or young healthy or ill tall orramesh chandra sharma v state of uttar

short or whether the owner has inherited the prope rty or
built it with his own efforts or whether the owner is polit ician
or an advocate why is this sort of classification not
sustainable because the object being to compulsorily acquire
for a public purpose the object is equally achieved  whether
the land belongs to one type of owner or another type
59 in our opinion a bare reading of the abovementioned  judgment
makes it amply clear that the classification made by t he gnoida
authority for the purposes of awarding differential compensa tion is bad
in law and it is precisely this kind of classification tha t has been barred
when the purpose of the acquisition of the land is for the benef it of the
public at large then the nature of the owner of th e said land is
inconsequential to the purpose if such a classification on t he basis of
the nature of owner is allowed then on the same grounds there might
be a possibility of future classifications where powerholdin g members
of the society may get away with a larger compensati on and the
marginalized may get lesser compensation this is precisely  what this
court in the abovementioned judgment predictedand to preempt s uch
arbitrary classification clarified the position in law
60 the land acquisition act does not distinguish bet ween classes
of owners and uniformly provides compensation to a ll class of
landowners the classification made between pushtaini landown ers and
gairpushtaini landowners on the basis of the reas oning mentioned above
is violative of the law laid down in the nagpur trust case supra  and
article 14 of the constitution
conclusion
61 in light of the abovementioned reasoning we a re of the opinion
that the classification made by both the executive actions i s bad in law
and is liable to be set aside the land acquisition act does not envisage
any differential compensation on the basis of such classifi cation and
hence this court must infer the compensation to be provided b y the
executive actions within the confines of section 23 of the ac t
62 section 23 of the land acquisition act states out the gr ounds
for granting compensation in cases of acquisition of land under the act
one such reason for the grant of compensation is rehabilitation and it is
this need for granting compensation for rehabilitation under th e act thata

is echoed by the impugned notification a bare reading of both the
executive actions in consonance with the act would show that the  need
for giving compensation for rehabilitation is valid  in law and is backed by
the parent statute the mischief then is only limited to t he arbitrary
classification made by such actions in such a case we are of the opinion
that since the mischief lies only within the classi fication it can be severed
and the remaining part of the executive actions that sets out to grant
compensation for the purpose of rehabilitation remains valid i n law
63  once the classification is removed and the executive ac tions
are read in consonance with the parent act we would see that  since the
act and now even the executive actions do not discriminate in terms of
compensation the exgratia payment and the increased ba se amount as
enunciated by the executive actions must be given to all l andowners in
the subject area
64 at this stage we would like to state that while the objecti ve of
the said classification might have been noble howev er such classification
only on the basis of conjectures and surmises cannot be sustai ned if a
claim is being made to differentiate between class of persons such claim
must be backed by empirical data while this court is no t a factfinding
court and is a court of law however the law must also not be understood
in isolation but in the context in which it exists as the  law does not exist
like an object within the statutes but lives and evolves wi th the people it
governs
65 further in cases of administrative action eve n if the
classification has a rational nexus to the objective of t he notification the
classification must also be legitimized by the parent sta tute if the parent
statute does not allow for a classification then even if the cl assification
visàvis the notification is able to pass the tests of a rticle 14 it would
still be liable to struck down if the parent statute doe s not allow for the
same
66  the establishment of greater noida as discussed above
was done for a noble purpose ie to accommodate in the cit y all those
who came travelling from every corner of the country in searc h of a
better life while doing so however as can be seen in the pr esent case
some residents whose land was subject to acquisition in the pursui t of
the said aim were faced with discrimination in such cir cumstance itramesh chandra sharma v state of uttar

becomes the duty of this court to dispense justice and rectif y the harm
caused to those at the receiving end of the discrimination
67 in view of the above discussions the impugned judgment passed
by the full bench of the high court is not liable to be sust ained and
stands set aside as a consequence the writ petiti on filed by the
appellants before the high court stands allowed and the appell ants are
held entitled to the reliefs claimed in the said writ petition
